						<h2>Representation Matters</h2>
					</div>
					<p>
						People are not always heard by their governments or leaders. Those
						that are underrepresented struggle to find a way to amplify their
						voice in a way that brings about true change.
						<br />
						<br />
						Quae gives everyone a voice.

						<h2>Democracy Fails Online</h2>
					</div>
					<p>
						There is still no reliable way to vote online. Polling exists, but
						it does not give you any power to start a movement on your own.
						Don't wait for those in charge to ask the right questions.
						<br />
						<br />
						Quae empowers you to ask them yourself.
					</p>

						<h2>Don't Wait 4 Years</h2>
					</div>
					<p>
						Today's problems are too pressing for you to wait until the next
						election. We let our leaders fail us on countless issues before we
						finally get the chance to have a say.
						<br />
						<br />

						People should not have to sit idly by while problems continue to
						worsen. They should decide what to do - then do it. Quae makes that
						possible.

						<h2>Vote Every Day</h2>
					</div>
					<p>
						By Voting Every Day, you have the power to represent yourself in
						your community. We believe that democracy only works when everyone
						participates. In the past, technology made this difficult. But
						today, we will make it happen.
