							We All Want to <i><b>Be Heard</b></i>
						</h2>
						<h6>
							The desire to be heard is an innate part of what makes us human
						</h6>
						<br />
						<p>
							As communities grew, it became harder for each person to feel
							heard -- to feel valued. In today's chaotic, fast-paced world,
							it's nearly impossible to feel like your input makes a difference
							on a larger scale. This is bad for each individual and for the
							greater community.
							<br />
							<br />
							Large communities struggle to engage all their members. Those that
							have been ignored for so long stop speaking up. Unrepresentative
							feedback strengthens the cycle that silences under served
							communities.

							Global movements captivate people and the media's attention but

							persuasion.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							There needs to be a way for people to organize their ideas and
							passion to
							<i>create</i> change, not ask for it. It needs to be easier for
							groups to advocate for themselves.

						<h5>Issues demand action now</h5>
					</div>
					<p>
						People are powerless between elections. They have no say on the
						issues that are affecting them in the here and now. Poor
						representation and no way to do anything about it leads to burnout
						and frustration. There needs to be a way for people to meaningfully
						participate in the democratic process on a daily basis.

					<h2>Representation Matters</h2>
					<p>
						We are committed to amplifying the voices of all people. At the same
						time, we want to prioritize historically under-represented
						communities. The power of a vote should be equal for all people -
						and that starts with making voting fair and easily accessible to all
						people.

						<h5>Quae puts representation on the cutting edge</h5>
					</div>
					<p>
						Quae utilizes modern technology to bring democracy to the 21st
						century. By giving everyone the opportunity and accessibility to
						propose solutions and verifiably vote on a daily basis, Quae
						eliminates the issue of having to wait for election cycles for
						citizens to have an impact.
						<br />
						<br />
						We envision a future where democracy thrives â€“ this means anyone can
						meaningfully participate in the democratic process, solutions with
						consensus will be enacted, and it will be impossible for a powerful
						few to block the wishes of the masses.
